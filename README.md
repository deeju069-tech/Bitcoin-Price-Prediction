Bitcoin Price Prediction using Machine Learning in Python


Pandas - This library helps to load the data frame in a 2D array format and has multiple functions to perform analysis tasks in one go.
Numpy - Numpy arrays are very fast and can perform large computations in a very short time.
Matplotlib/Seaborn - This library is used to draw visualizations.
Sklearn - This module contains multiple libraries having pre-implemented functions to perform tasks from data preprocessing to model development and evaluation.
XGBoost - This contains the eXtreme Gradient Boosting machine learning algorithm which is one of the algorithms which helps us to achieve high accuracy on predictions.
